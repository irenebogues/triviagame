#objectives of the game

I will create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (my choice).
The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.
The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
The players dont have an option to pick one or more answers
A countdown timer is included to add more challenge to the players.
